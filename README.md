## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cristobalvch/spotiscience.git
cd spotiscience
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

```python
import spotiscience

#create a dictionary with authorization keys
CREDENTIALS = {}
CREDENTIALS['client_id'] = "your_spotify_client_id"
CREDENTIALS['client_secret'] = "your_spotify_client_secret"
CREDENTIALS['redirect_url'] = "your_redirect_url"
CREDENTIALS['user_id'] = "your_spotify_user_id"
CREDENTIALS['genius_access_token'] = "your_genius_access_token"

"""You also can set your credentials id on credentials.py and import from spotiscience"""

# returns 'downloader class'
sd = spotiscience.SpotiScienceDownloader(credentials=CREDENTIALS)

# returns 'predicter class'
sp = spotiscience.SpotiSciencePredicter()

```
## Download Music Data

```python
# Returns song features

song_copy_link = "https://open.spotify.com/track/0VjIjW4GlUZAMYd2vXMi3b?si=369f90167c9d48fb"
song = sd.get_song_features(song_id=song_copy_link)
song

## Topic Modelling and Music Mood Prediction

```python
#predict the mood of the song
mood = sp.predict_song_mood(song=song)
mood

[output]
'energy'

#predict the topics of the song lyric
topics = sp.predict_topic_lyric(lyric=lyrics,model='lda',lang='english',n_grams=(1,1),n_topics=1,top_n=5)
topics

[output]
defaultdict(list,
            {'Topic 0:': [[('hey', 8.249863616778203),
               ('ooh', 6.627924700037221),
               ('touch', 5.011524363507339),
               ('light', 4.997437601882748),
               ('feel', 4.23125338314076)]]})
